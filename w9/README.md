# My Understanding
- From what i watched and from the articles you gave us on MD i think I have a good understanding.
    - The local storage is to help websites on the browser hold local information such as input from the forms we create, log in information and anything that we don't want lost once the page is closed.
    - The local storage allows us to store the data even when we close the page or leave.
    - Local storage can only store texts and in order to hold more advanced data we need JSON.
    - JSON turns data into text and back into normal data when we need to use it or code or etc.
    - Each website page has it's own local storage for each file.
    - anything that isn't an interger will be stringified 
    - to see the objects we can head to applications page to see the different integers. demo 1, demo 2.
    - there are two ways to get to the local storage which is
        - directly using setItem and getItem
        - a Wrapper Function which uses functions to keep our code clean.
    - When we convert data like objects and arrays into a format, we have to Serialize the Data. (what JSON helps us do).
# Questions
- Is local Storage best used for each page to prevent data loss once leaving
- Is the sole purpose of local storage just to prevent data loss or to keep preferences and input or can it be used for other ideas. (sorry if the questions don't make sense).
